1. Overview
In display and mobile advertising, the most relevant technical development in recent years
is the growth of Real-Time Bidding (RTB). Billions of display ad impressions are purchased
on a daily basis through a public auction hosted by RTB exchanges. The auction is per
impression and the process usually occurs less than 100 milliseconds before the ad is
placed.
In this context, demand side platforms (DSPs) were created to help advertisers manage
their campaigns and optimise their real-time bidding activities. One of their main tasks is to
predict the click-through rate (CTR) for ads and calculate the bid price according to the
estimated CTR.
For this challenge, Jampp, one of the key players in the mobile adtech industry, has
provided a week's worth of data to build and test models predicting CTR. Can you find
good strategy for making these predictions?
2. Data
File descriptions
- train: The training set consists of a portion of Jampp's click-through data over a period of
7 days, not necessarily chronologically ordered (however a time column is provided).
- test: The test set consists of Jampp's traffic on the day following the training period
(computed/sampled in the same way as the training set).
- sample_submission.csv: A sample submission file in the correct format.

time).
- auction_age: the user's age
- auction_bidfloor: bidfloor (the minimum value you can bid for)
- auction_boolean_0: a boolean variable regarding an attribute of the auction
- auction_boolean_1: a boolean variable regarding an attribute of the auction
- auction_boolean_2: a boolean variable regarding an attribute of the auction_not_track

- auction_categorical_7: an entity id related to a component of the auction
- auction_categorical_8: an entity id related to a component of the auction
- auction_categorical_9: an entity id related to a component of the auction
- auction_categorical_10: a categorical variable
- auction_categorical_11: an entity id related to a component of the auction
- auction_categorical_12: a categorical variable
- auction_list_0: a list of categories related to the auction
- creative_categorical_0: business unit id
- creative_categorical_1: a categorical variable
- creative_categorical_10: a categorical variable

- creative_width: the creative's width (in pixels)
- device_id: the device id. This is a unique identifier for a device (or close to unique)
- device_id_type: the type of device id (there are many types, also a device can have
many different types, with a different id for each of them)
- gender: gender
- has_video: a boolean value indicating if the banner contains a video.
- timezone_offset: timezone offset in hours based on the auction's country and region.
